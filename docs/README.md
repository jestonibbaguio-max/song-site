- `Local Swagger UI`: development-only tooling; never exposed in production.
- `Configuration`: environment-driven and owned by `danny.c.francisco` under `WP-013`.
- `Production readiness`: cross-cutting remediation owned by `danny.c.francisco` under `WP-018`.

See [Work package tracking](work-packages.md) for the current implementation inventory.

See [API and data inventory](api-data-inventory.md) for the complete site review.

See [Navigation flows](navigation-flows.md) for the implemented main flow and planned admin dashboard flow.

## Engineering handbooks

- [FED Handbook](handbooks/fed-handbook.md) - Angular frontend development, SSO-safe UI, unit tests, and Playwright guidance.
- [BED Handbook](handbooks/bed-handbook.md) - Express API, adapters, migrations, PostgreSQL, SSO, and RBAC.
- [QA Handbook](handbooks/qa-handbook.md) - test layers, test planning, release gates, exploratory testing, and defect handling.

Local environment variables are documented in [Local development](runbooks/local-development.md). Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and keep real identity values local.

## Planned documentation

- `openapi/`: versioned API contract and generated artifacts
- `runbooks/`: local setup, migrations, deployment, and rollback procedures
- [PostgreSQL Compose runbook](runbooks/postgresql-compose.md) - production-like local stack operations.
- [Testing and release runbook](runbooks/testing-and-release.md) - verification and release evidence.
- [Incident response runbook](runbooks/incident-response.md) - triage, security, data, recovery, and closure.
- `decisions/`: unresolved architecture questions and accepted follow-up proposals

## Current implementation questions

1. Which identity provider is authoritative for production users and group membership?
2. Which roles and permissions are required for the first release?
3. Is a work package assigned to one user, a team, or both?
4. Which status transitions are allowed, and who may perform each transition?
5. Which existing JSON data must be migrated into the database?
6. Is SQLite only for developer convenience, or must it also support offline/demo deployments?
