# Work Package Tracking

This inventory records what is already present in the repository and connects it to the architecture decisions. `Implemented` means code exists today; it does not mean the area is production-ready.

## Tags

- `WP-*`: work package identifier.
- `ADR-*`: architecture decision that governs the work.
- `Implemented`: visible code exists in the current repository.
- `In progress`: implementation exists but the target architecture is incomplete.
- `Planned`: not implemented yet.
- `ADR complete`: the decision is documented and accepted; it does not imply the work package is complete.

## Definition of complete

A work package is complete only when its OpenAPI contract, implementation, migration (if applicable), authorization rules, automated tests, and runbook are present. Existing UI or JSON endpoints alone are not sufficient.

## Next sequence

1. Complete `WP-018` security, contract, persistence, lifecycle, and verification gates before calling the local API production-ready.
2. Confirm the Journey resource and Work Package vocabulary with the requester.
3. Implement the API contract without changing the existing UI behavior.
4. Add PostgreSQL production support and verify parity with migration-backed local data.
5. Add RBAC enforcement and negative authorization tests.
6. Add Playwright configuration and critical Journey workflows under `WP-009`.
7. Keep the completed local-only Swagger UI covered by a production-exclusion smoke test.
8. Decide the target API/table inventory and expand the current content tables into the normalized domain model under `WP-011`.
9. Keep the single-backend runtime boundary covered by deployment and smoke tests.
10. Complete environment-driven identity configuration and remove remaining hardcoded authentication fallbacks under `WP-013`.
11. Confirm and implement the complete domain table model under `WP-014` before expanding the production API.
12. Add PostgreSQL equivalents and CI coverage for the database lifecycle under `WP-006` and `WP-015`.
13. Add authenticated content writes, OpenAPI response schemas, and PostgreSQL migrations for the content tables under `WP-011` and `WP-014`.
14. Define and implement the admin/users API and landing page under `WP-016`, after identity and RBAC foundations are available.
15. Implement PostgreSQL integration under `WP-017`: adapter, migrations, CI service, deployment secrets, backup, and rollback/forward-fix runbook.
16. Do not promote the static GitHub Pages frontend until an externally reachable API is configured and smoke-tested under `WP-018`.
17. Review and resolve `ADR-0018` through `ADR-0022` before assigning production implementation work that depends on those decisions.
18. Review and resolve `ADR-0023` before expanding the temporary announcement update API or treating the dedicated Announcement page as database-backed.
19. Review and resolve `ADR-0024` before introducing any future import or production data-management process.
20. Review and resolve `ADR-0025` before exposing remaining asset fixtures as production APIs or adding managed binary uploads.
21. Keep `WP-027` closed; active ATCP Song data remains owned by the database-backed leadership API.
22. Keep `WP-028` deferred; do not implement or advertise org-chart routes until a replacement ADR and scope are approved.
23. Review and resolve `ADR-0028` before treating SQLite checks, frontend tests, or deployment success as production compatibility evidence.
24. Review and resolve `ADR-0029` before enabling existing leadership maintenance for production users; org-chart maintenance remains out of scope.
