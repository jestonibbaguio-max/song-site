# FED Handbook

Frontend engineering guide for Song Site. This handbook is written for associates through advanced engineers and is the day-to-day companion to the ADRs.

## 1. What you are working on

Song Site is an Angular 21 standalone application in `src/`. It provides the Song Bench experience, public/guest navigation, authenticated user journeys, leadership content, and the frontend side of the SSO experience.

The frontend is responsible for:

- page composition, navigation, responsive presentation, and accessibility;
- calling the backend through typed service boundaries;
- presenting authenticated and guest states without bypassing backend authorization;
- local UI state and form validation;
- unit tests colocated with the feature under test; and
- Playwright journeys when a behavior crosses routing, authentication state, or the API boundary.

The frontend is not responsible for deciding whether a user may mutate data. The backend remains authoritative for authentication and authorization.

## 2. Repository map

| Area | Location | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App bootstrap and routes | `src/app/app.config.ts`, `src/app/app.routes.ts` | Keep route configuration explicit and lazy-load feature areas where practical. |
| Authentication | `src/app/auth/` | Preserve MSAL redirect handling, active-account selection, and redirect URI normalization. |
| Shared navigation | `src/app/navbar/`, `src/app/footer/` | Guest menus may be visible; edit controls must reflect effective permission and API responses. |
| ATCP Song | `src/app/atcp-song/` | Prefer service/model boundaries over direct HTTP calls in components. |
| Journey | `src/app/song-bench/` | Keep task-specific behavior in its feature folder and preserve existing route names. |
| Tests | Beside source files | Use the existing `*.spec.ts` or `*.specs.ts` naming convention. |
| API contract | `docs/openapi/song-site.yaml` | Update the contract before changing a public API call. |

## 3. Standard feature workflow

1. Read the relevant ADR, work package, API contract, and navigation flow.
2. Identify the guest, authenticated, read-only, and edit states before writing UI code.
3. Add or update the model and service boundary.
4. Add the component/template/styles with accessible labels, keyboard behavior, and responsive layout.
5. Add colocated unit tests for the service and component behavior.
6. Add or update a Playwright test for a critical user journey when the route/API/auth boundary is involved.
7. Run focused tests, the full frontend suite, production build, and `git diff --check`.
8. Document API, permission, migration, or deployment changes before opening the pull request.

## 4. SSO rules

The application uses MSAL browser redirect flow. Do not replace it with a local mock in production code or alter the redirect behavior to make a test pass.

- Use `AuthService` as the frontend identity boundary.
- Do not log access tokens, claims, or personally identifiable information.
- Keep `VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_ENTRA_TENANT_ID`, and redirect values in environment configuration.
- A guest is an unauthenticated visitor, not an anonymous editor.
- A signed-in user may still be read-only; render edit controls only when the permission contract says they are allowed.
- Always handle initialization and redirect-loading states so the UI does not briefly show the wrong access state.

## 5. Leadership UI

The current FED experience renders grouped leadership content from `GET /api/leadership`. Preserve that response shape and rendering behavior. The previously supplied organizational-chart image is not a product specification; do not copy its branding, logos, decorative labels, or footer into the product.

Any future leadership editor must show controls only to users with the matching permission, but the backend remains the source of truth. Hiding a button is only a usability improvement, not a security control. Organizational-chart UI is deferred and must not be added implicitly as part of normal leadership maintenance.

## 6. Angular implementation standards

- Prefer standalone components and explicit imports.
- Keep components focused on presentation and orchestration; put reusable API behavior in services.
- Use signals and computed state consistently with the existing application style.
- Avoid subscriptions that are not cleaned up; prefer Angular lifecycle-safe patterns.
- Give interactive controls accessible names and visible focus states.
- Do not add a new global dependency for a feature that can use existing Angular APIs.
- Keep CSS local to the feature unless a style is intentionally shared.
- Preserve existing URLs and deep-link behavior.
- Do not store server-authoritative mutations only in `localStorage`.

## 7. Frontend testing

Minimum expectation for new code:

- service tests cover successful response mapping, failure handling, and request shape;
- component tests cover rendering, user interaction, loading/error/empty states, and permission-sensitive controls;
- route or auth-sensitive behavior has a Playwright test when practical;
- regression tests are added for every fixed defect.

Useful commands from the repository root:

```bash
npm run test:ci
npm run build:ci
npm run verify
```

The current repository has Playwright coverage for production/SSO skip behavior in `playwright-prod-skip-sso.spec.ts`; expand it with real authenticated fixtures only when the test environment can provide them safely.

## 8. Definition of done

- Feature works for guest, authenticated read-only, and authorized edit states.
- SSO redirect and logout behavior is unchanged unless explicitly documented.
- API and OpenAPI changes agree.
- Unit tests are colocated and pass.
- Relevant Playwright coverage exists or the pull request records why it is deferred.
- Production build passes without introducing avoidable warnings.
- No secrets, tokens, generated databases, or local environment files are committed.
