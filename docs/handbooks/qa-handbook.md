# QA Handbook

Quality engineering guide for Song Site. It covers exploratory testing, automated tests, release confidence, and defect communication for associate through advanced practitioners.

## 1. Quality model

QA validates behavior across four dimensions:

1. **Functional** — the feature does what the contract says.
2. **Security** — guests, authenticated users, and privileged users receive only the access intended for them.
3. **Compatibility** — SQLite development and PostgreSQL production-like environments do not diverge unexpectedly.
4. **Usability** — navigation, errors, keyboard behavior, responsive layout, and SSO states are understandable.

Testing is continuous. QA participates during refinement, implementation, pull request review, release, and incident follow-up.

## 2. Test layers

| Layer | Purpose | Typical command/location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend unit | Components, services, state, and mapping | `npm run test:ci`; colocated `*.spec.ts` |
| Backend unit | Adapter and API logic | `cd backend && npm test` |
| PostgreSQL integration | Schema, queries, adapter behavior, and API against PostgreSQL | Compose stack and API smoke checks |
| Playwright | Browser journeys, routing, guest/auth states, and critical UI behavior | `playwright-*.spec.ts` |
| Build verification | Production compilation and packaging | `npm run build:ci`, `docker compose build` |
| Exploratory | Real-world behavior, accessibility, and edge cases | Test charter/checklist |

## 3. Test planning template

For every feature, record:

- user/persona: guest, valid user, editor, or administrator;
- preconditions and required data;
- happy path;
- validation and empty states;
- network/API failure;
- unauthorized (`401`) and forbidden (`403`) behavior;
- SSO initialization, redirect, and logout impact;
- browser/responsive/accessibility checks;
- data cleanup requirements; and
- evidence: test output, screenshots, logs, or Playwright trace.

## 4. Leadership checklist

- Guest can see the intended leadership menu/view.
- Unauthenticated users cannot perform protected leadership mutations.
- Authenticated read-only users can view but do not receive edit capability.
- Authorized users can update an existing leadership record with valid data.
- Invalid leadership payloads and identifiers are rejected clearly.
- Updates reflect in the next read.
- Existing SSO login/logout behavior remains intact.
- Empty, loading, error, and slow-network states are usable.
- The visual result preserves the existing leadership page and does not reproduce mock branding.

## 5. Playwright guidance

Keep browser tests focused on user-observable outcomes:

- navigate to a stable route;
- wait for the application readiness state;
- use accessible roles/labels instead of brittle CSS selectors;
- avoid fixed sleeps;
- isolate test data or clean up mutations;
- never put real credentials or tokens in the repository;
- use a safe authenticated fixture only in an approved test environment; and
- capture a trace/screenshot on failure.

If SSO cannot be exercised in CI, explicitly test the unauthenticated/skip path and record the missing authenticated coverage as a release risk.

## 6. Defect severity

| Severity | Example | Expected response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Data loss, auth bypass, production outage | Stop release; page owner/on-call immediately. |
| High | Core journey unavailable, broken SSO, incorrect protected mutation | Fix or formally waive before release. |
| Medium | Feature degraded with workaround | Prioritize for the release or document acceptance. |
| Low | Cosmetic or minor copy/layout issue | Track for normal backlog. |

Every defect should include environment, build/commit, exact steps, expected/actual result, affected persona, evidence, and whether data cleanup is needed.

## 7. Release gate

Before release, QA checks:

- focused tests for changed areas;
- complete frontend unit suite;
- backend unit suite;
- production frontend build;
- Docker Compose build and smoke test when backend/database behavior changed;
- OpenAPI and migration review;
- SSO and RBAC regression checklist;
- no secrets or local database files in the change; and
- documented known risks and rollback/forward-fix plan.

## 8. Test data and safety

Use synthetic users and records. Do not copy production personal data into local databases or screenshots. Clean up created leadership records after tests unless the environment is disposable. Redact tokens, cookies, connection strings, and personal data from evidence.
